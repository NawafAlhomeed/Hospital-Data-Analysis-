# Project Title: Exploring Python's Capabilities with Pandas

## Overview

This project is a personal exploration of Python's data manipulation capabilities using the pandas library. It is designed to showcase basic to intermediate pandas operations in a straightforward and accessible manner.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. A link to the dataset is provided in the repository.

## Project Focus

* **Python and Pandas**: The primary goal is to demonstrate how pandas can be used for data manipulation and analysis in a simple and clear way.
* **Visualization with Power BI**: While pandas handles the data transformation, the visualization part will be done in Power BI for ease and simplicity.

## Notes

* The dataset is already cleaned and ready for analysis; no data cleaning steps are included.
* This project is not structured as an educational tutorial but rather as a personal exploration.
